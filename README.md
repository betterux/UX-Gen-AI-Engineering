## What I Do

_Let's design the future together! :wave:_

**What is GitHub?**: I design and build Generative AI solutions that make technology more adaptive, helpful, and seamless. My work sits at the intersection of UX, AI, and automation, ensuring that AI-driven products feel natural, solve real problems, and enhance human capabilities.

ðŸ”¹ Generative AI for UX â€“ Designing adaptive, personalized interfaces powered by AI.
ðŸ”¹ AI-Driven Search & Discovery â€“ Creating intelligent search systems that predict intent.
ðŸ”¹ LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering â€“ Optimizing language models for usability.
ðŸ”¹ AI-Powered Automation â€“ Enhancing business workflows with AI-driven efficiencies.
ðŸ”¹ Conversational AI & NLP â€“ Building context-aware chatbots and virtual assistants.
ðŸ”¹ AI Ethics & Responsible Design â€“ Ensuring AI solutions are fair, transparent, and user-first.


Branches allow you to separate your work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute. For more information, see "[About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your newly made repository. Then, work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.

   ![code-tab](/images/code-tab.png)

3. Click on the **main** branch drop-down.

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. In this case, the name must be `my-first-branch` to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to create your branch.

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
